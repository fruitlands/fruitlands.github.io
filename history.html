        <p style="text-align:center">Fruitlands has quite a long and illustrious history. It was originally founded as a gold mining community, named Bald Hill Flat in the early 19th century. Around the area there are plenty of relics of the past, such as gold mines, old miner's cottages and the assorted tools that they used to make their living.</a></p>

        <h3 class="customheader">Gold Mining</h3>
          <p style="text-align:center">Bald Hill Flat (now known as Fruitlands) was originally formed as a gold mining community in August 1863. The land was scoured in search of gold and for the first few years it was plentiful. The miners who worked the land have left marks that are clearly visible even today, such as cottages containing relics of the past, and large tailings and mines like the one pictured above.</p>
